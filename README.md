# Problem Context

XYZ Laboratories is a research lab that employs around 10,000 scientists, ranging from chemistry, biology and physics.

Their facilities contain multiple labs wherein each scientist can run experiments for their research. Some of the experiments carried out require very specific monitoring over the temperature values throughout the whole experiment.

Related to these experiments, this company has hired your team to develop a `Temperature Observability` microservice which has 2 main responsibilities:
- To provide a historic trace of the temperature values throughout an experiment.
- To notify the researcher when the temperature values are not within a pre-defined range for that experiment. 

## Experiment Process

The research centre has many physical spaces available for the temperature-controlled experiments. These spaces can be of any size, and therefore the researcher has to set the environment so as to have the right amount of sensors for the physical space required for the experiment. This also means that for each experiment, there might be an arbitrary number of sensors monitoring the temperature. The physical space's temperature in these conditions is defined as the average temperature of all sensors allocated to an experiment.

It is fundamental that the physical space where the experiment is to be carried out has reached its desired temperature. The desired range is specific to each experiment and defined by the researcher while configuring the experiment. 

Lastly, the experiment is carried out for as long as the researcher desires. However whenever the temperature for an experiment falls out of range, the researcher has to be notified.

The stages are:

1. Experiment configuration phase: This is where the researcher configures the requirements for the experiment, and involves specifying: Sensors that will track the temperature of the physical space; The allowed temperature range for the experiment; and the researcher's email address for notifications;
2. Stabilization phase: The temperature is being controlled to reach the values within the range specified by the researcher (the experiment hasn't yet started at this stage);
3. Carrying out the experiment: Temperature measurements are expected to be within the range specified in the configuration phase (otherwise the researcher has to be notified).
4. Experiment termination: The researcher informs that the experiment is no longer running, and no more temperature measurements are produced.

Your microservice will have to keep track of several experiments running concurrently, each with their own temperature ranges, sensors, duration and sampling rate.

## Functional Requirements

- [ ] The system should allow a researcher to configure an experiment.
- [ ] The system should provide a REST endpoint that allows querying the time-intervals during which the temperature fell out of the defined temperature range for an experiment.
- [ ] The system should notify the “Notifications” microservice via a REST endpoint when the temperature value for an experiment is out of the defined temperature range.
- [ ] The implemented microservice should have a monitoring component that provides an overview of the microservice’s costs over time.
- [ ] The system should be able to scale based on the system's load.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] The system should notify the “Notifications” service within 10 seconds from when the temperature values deviate for each experiment given there are no more than 100 experiments running concurrently each with a sampling rate of $1s$.

# Technical Details

Your microservice has to monitor all temperature experiments carried out throughout the XYZ research centre.

The following figure provides an overview of the system:

![System Overview](https://github.com/landaudiogo/cc-assignment-2023/assets/26680755/8792e516-fc37-41a8-bb14-61bf20121be0)

The service your team will have to implement, is the one highlighted in yellow. Your service will
have to either provide or interact with the following interfaces:
- Interface 1 - Your service will have to implement a Kafka consumer that reads data from
a Kafka topic where the data regarding an experiment's procedure is produced. The
information is produced to the `<team_id>` topic, where `<team_id>` is an identifier
unique to each team.
- Interface 2 - Your service will have to provide a Temperature Observability REST API for
researchers to consult the historic temperature value for their experiments. The main
queries will be the temperature values for a specified time interval and the time instants
throughout an experiment wherein the temperature fell outside of the range specified in
the experiment's configuration.
- Interface 3 - Your service will have to interact with the Notifications REST API. This is
the service that has to be notified to communicate any event to a researcher.

A service's interface is what exposes its functionalities to users or services that can
communicate with it. Your team's assignment consists of designing and implementing a system
that complies with the functional and non-functional requirements while exposing the
aforementioned interfaces. Additionally, as long as your services are running as containers,
your team has the liberty to choose any service, or any programming language to develop the
Temperature Observability Microservice.

## Interfaces

To illustrate the different events throughout an experiment, we will use an example wherein an
experiment requires the temperature to be between 25-26 °C. The following diagram contains a
representation of the event's lifecycle:

![Line Chart Events drawio](https://github.com/landaudiogo/cc-assignment-2023/assets/26680755/904794dc-b6af-44af-ac9c-f33d78cc1e8f)

Annotation 1 marks the moment an “Experiment Configuration Event” was published. This event
is communicated by the researcher to indicate: the temperature sensors that are to be used
during the experiment; An experiment's temperature range; Other tracking information.

Annotation 2 marks the moment “Stabilization Started Event” was published. This event is
communicated by the researcher to indicate when the temperature controller is controlling the
physical space's temperature to be within the desired range. Starting from annotation `2-6`,
temperature measurements are sent to the `<team_id>` topic.

Annotation 3 marks the moment the temperature in the experiment's physical space has
reached the desired range specified in the experiment configuration event. **Your microservice
has to notify the researcher of this event.**

Annotation 4 marks the moment the “Experiment Started Event” was published. This event
indicates the moment the researcher has started the experiment. From this moment onward,
your microservice has to be aware of when the experiment's temperature falls out-of-range to
notify the main researcher.

Annotation 5 marks the moment the experiment's temperature falls out-of-range, which requires
notifying the researcher through the notifications service. The remaining measurements which
are out-of-range until the temperature stabilizes again are not notified, only
the measurement taken at Annotation 5.

Annotation 6 marks the moment the Experiment Terminated Event is published indicating the
end of the experiment. From this moment onward, no more measurement or data referring to
that experiment is sent to the `<team_id>` topic, but queries related to the experiment's
temperature values can be performed via the Temperature Observability REST API.

### Topic Events

The XYZ research centre manages a kafka cluster with a topic named `<team_id>` that contains
data related to the state of an experiment. In Kafka’s context, a topic is where events are
published to and consumed from (by data producers and consumers respectively). As such, this
is also the data your microservice will have to consume to track each experiment’s state.

Each event published into the `<team_id>` topic is serialized using the avro format schema. The
following sections will describe each event and provide an example payload and schema for
each event. Also, each event published into the topic has a header `record_name` which
indicates the type of the message.

#### Experiment Configuration Event

This event configures an experiment and involves specifying: Sensors that will track the
temperature of the physical space; The allowed temperature range for the experiment; and the
researcher's email address for notifications.

As such, if the main researcher for experiment an experiment with id `9ee55bd4-a531-409c-
9a64-0398353cadc5` has the email `d.landau@uu.nl`, and the physical environment has been
setup to contain the sensors with ids `["66cc5dc0-d75a-40ee-88d5-0308017191af", "ac5e0ea2-
a04d-4eb3-a6e3-206d47ffe9e1"]`, and the maximum allowed temperature is `26` and the
minimum temperature is `25`, then the configuration event would look like:

```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"researcher": "d.landau@uu.nl",	
	"sensors": [
		"66cc5dc0-d75a-40ee-88d5-0308017191af", 
		"ac5e0ea2-a04d-4eb3-a6e3-206d47ffe9e1"
	],
	"temperature_range": {
		"upper_threshold": 26.0,
		"lower_threshold": 25.0,
	}
}
```

The researcher field contains the email of the researcher who has to be notified by the notifications service.

Event avro schema: 
```json
{
    "type": "record", 
    "name": "ExperimentConfig", 
    "fields": [
        {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "experiment"
        },
        {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "researcher"
        },
        {
            "name": "sensors", 
            "type": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": "string"
            }
        }, 
        {
            "name": "temperature_range",
            "type": {
                "type": "record",
                "name": "temperature_range",
                "fields": [
                    {"name": "upper_threshold", "type": "float"},
                    {"name": "lower_threshold", "type": "float"}
                ]
            } 
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Stabilization Started Event

This event signals the time at which the experiment's physical space's temperature started
being controlled. After this event has been published to the topic, “Sensor Temperature
Measured” events will follow. For this reason, it is also the moment your microservice has to
start monitoring the experiment’s temperature values.

**The temperature values throughout the stabilization phase do not have to be stored for historic querying**. However, the experiment’s temperature must be monitored since the
researcher has to be notified when the temperature has reached the range indicated in the
configuration event.

An example payload for this event:
```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"timestamp": 1691419380.9467194
}
```

Event avro schema:
```json
{
    "type": "record", 
    "name": "stabilization_started", 
    "fields": [
        {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "experiment"
        },
        {
            "name": "timestamp", 
            "type": "double"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Experiment Started Event

This event marks the time at which the researcher has started the experiment. `Sensor Temperature Measured` events consumed after this moment have to be stored for further consultation by a researcher via the Temperature Observability REST API. 

Example event: 
```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"timestamp": 1691419385.9467194
}
```

Schema: 
```json
{
    "type": "record", 
    "name": "experiment_started", 
    "fields": [
        {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "experiment"
        },
        {
            "name": "timestamp", 
            "type": "double"
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Sensor Temperature Measured Event

An experiment's physical space temperature is the average temperature measured by all the sensors allocated to an experiment. Resorting to the example provided in the `Experiment Configuration`, let us consider that we have 2 sensors allocated to our experiment, `66cc5dc0-d75a-40ee-88d5-0308017191af` and `ac5e0ea2-a04d-4eb3-a6e3-206d47ffe9e1`. To calculate the experiment's measured temperature at timestamp `1691419376.9467194`, we need 1 measurement per sensor. If for sensor `66cc5dc0-d75a-40ee-88d5-0308017191af` we get the event:
```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"sensor": "66cc5dc0-d75a-40ee-88d5-0308017191af",
	"measurement-id": "fb5b8af2-9309-46c8-bcbe-87c98b407c3d",
	"timestamp":  1691419390.9467194, 
	"temperature": 25.5, 
	"measurement_hash": "R8n76xYE4v/AUk1X5hM/+kkLHH5KYdoDpKiz7dUxybXaq++DcjXcuqM4GxNFg/jbvjmTnS/rh7FKoXvjJu1sg4Gc/cELVkDJ+ZWl0HTS81AfyQQmFH/CID53T3ynTtFmYATtWCnGxWiHffo/RFVSNXdQQvb2x5YBFA4DX7mznPpaC3qzwtzGEGgYtkDkzS0cVC4Kd5gWgJwInx7SHBIoflHZvfzUi329vIU"
}
```
and for sensor `ac5e0ea2-a04d-4eb3-a6e3-206d47ffe9e1`, the event: 
```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"sensor": "ac5e0ea2-a04d-4eb3-a6e3-206d47ffe9e1",
	"measurement-id": "fb5b8af2-9309-46c8-bcbe-87c98b407c3d",
	"timestamp":  1691419390.9467194, 
	"temperature": 25.3, 
	"measurement_hash": "R8n76xYE4v/AUk1X5hM/+kkLHH5KYdoDpKiz7dUxybXaq++DcjXcuqM4GxNFg/jbvjmTnS/rh7FKoXvjJu1sg4Gc/cELVkDJ+ZWl0HTS81AfyQQmFH/CID53T3ynTtFmYATtWCnGxWiHffo/RFVSNXdQQvb2x5YBFA4DX7mznPpaC3qzwtzGEGgYtkDkzS0cVC4Kd5gWgJwInx7SHBIoflHZvfzUi329vIU"
}
```
the temperature measured in the experiment's physical space is $(25.3 + 25.5)/2 = 25.4$. This final value ($25.4$), is the value that has to be compared with the range provided in the experiment configuration to determine whether the researcher has to be notified. This is also the value that has to be stored as the experiment's temperature at timestamp `1691404551.541` when a researcher queries for the experiment's temperature values via the Temperature Observability REST API. 

As shown in the previous 2 measurements, both have the same `measurement-id` field. This is important when communicating to the notification service the ID of the measurement being notified. This field is used by the Notification Service to calculate your service's notification latency.

**Important Note**:
In the example above, the `measurement_hash` field is also the same for both measurements.
If your service considers that the average temperature falls out of range and has to notify the
notifications service, one of the fields in the post request to the notifications REST API is the
`cipher_data`. This field in the post request has to be filled out with the value shown in the
`measurement_hash`. Based on this hash value, the notifications service will inform your
service whether you correctly notified a given measurement or not.

    "type": "record", 
    "name": "sensor_temperature_measured", 
    "fields": [
        {

            "name": "measurement_hash", 
            "type": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```
#### Experiment Terminated Event

This event marks the end of an experiment. No more temperature measurements are received after publishing this event. 

Example event: 
```json
{
	"experiment": "9ee55bd4-a531-409c-9a64-0398353cadc5",
	"timestamp": 1691419395.9467194
}
```

Event avro schema: 
```json
{
    "type": "record", 
    "name": "experiment_terminated", 
    "fields": [
        {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "experiment"
        },
        {
            "name": "timestamp", 
            "type": "double"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Temperature Observability REST API

This is the REST API your service should expose for a researcher to consult the historic
temperature values for an experiment. 

**IMPORTANT: The requests only refer to the carry-out phase of an experiment. I.e., only the measurements after an experiment's experiment_started event should be considered for the following endpoints.**

#### Experiment Out-of-Range Endpoint

Given an experiment as input, this endpoint should return the list of measurements during which an experiment was out of the temperature range specified in the experiment configuration event.

### Notifications API

This is the service you will have to notify when communicating certain events related to an experiment. You will not have to implement this interface, but you will have to interact with it, and as such, this section describes the notification service REST API interface.

#### Notify Endpoint

Notifies a researcher of a temperature stabilized or an out-of-range temperature measurement event.

##### Request

POST `/notify`

Body Parameters: 
- `notification_type`: An enum which indicates the type of notification to be
  sent to the researcher (Stabilized/OutOfRange).
- `researcher`: The researcher's email to be notified. 
- `experiment_id`: The experiment's ID to which the measurement belongs.
- `measurement_id`: The temperature measurement that concerns this
  notification.
- `cipher_data`: This value represents the `measurement_hash` value in a
  measurement’s event payload. Through the data contained in this value, the
  notifications service determines whether it was correctly notified of a
  stabilized or out-of-range event.

# Development Setup

Your team will have access to a single VM on the cloud where you will be deploying your services. 

We will provide you with the other external services so you can test how your system is behaving in a controlled environment. These will be: 
- A Kafka topic which only your group has access to. Your group will have full control over the topic.
- A load generator for your kafka topic that publishes the streams of events for an experiment.
- A notification service for your microservice to notify a researcher.

You may find these external services in [this repository](https://github.com/EC-labs/cec-assignment).

# Evaluation

The assignment evaluation will consist of 3 components:
- Demo 
- Architecture Assessment

## Demo

Your implementation will be put to test during a Demo Session. The demo consists of:

- Verficating data consistency (endpoint integration testing): Load will be generated for your microservice to consume, followed by querying the rest endpoints provided by your service to evaluate the consistency of the data presented by your team's microservice.
- Stress testing the architecture scalability (implementation scalability):
  Evaluate how your architecture performs under varying load intensities
  generated by our workloads. The workload patterns will not be shared
  beforehand, and therefore, the architecture is expected to be flexible to
  different workload intensities. We will evaluate your microservice's
  performance based on notification latency (<= 10s) and whether you can keep up with the HTTP request load.

## Architecture Assessment

To evaluate the architecture, during the demo session there will be a short discussion to understand the main design decisions taken by your team, followed by a qualitative assessment of the arcthitecture included in the report based on the principles of:
- Seperation of Concerns: Evaluates the modularity of your architecture, and whether each service has distinct responsibilities, or if it has too many responsibilities.
- Scalability: Analysis of your microservice’s theoretical scale.

# Contact

If you have any questions regarding the assignment, feel free to message me on teams or sending me an email via `d.landau@uu.nl`.
